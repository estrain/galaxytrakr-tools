# galaxytrakr-tools


This repository contains [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) tools, data managers, and workflows developed for the [GalaxyTrakr](https://galaxytrakr.org/) platform.  
Tools in this collection support microbial genomics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance, and food safety applications.

This repository is primarily intended for tools that are **not maintained as part of the standard [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/)** or **[IUC](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/)** repositories â€” either because they are specific to GalaxyTrakr, or because new software releases have not yet been updated in the [Galaxy ToolShed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).

Containers built from tools in this repository are hosted at [**quay.io/galaxytrakr**](https://quay.io/galaxytrakr).
